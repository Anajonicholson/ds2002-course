# Lab 1: The Command Line

Follow all the steps below for practice with the command line. At the bottom are instructions for commands you should write for each prompt, saved to a text file you create using the command line. Upload that file to the Lab assignment page for grading. Windows users should use git-bash to complete these steps. MacOS users should use the terminal application, found in Applications -> Utilities.

Getting Oriented to your Home Directory

1. Change directories to your home directory by issuing the `cd ~` command. `cd` is short for "change directory". This is a shortcut to your home directory.

```
cd ~
```

2. Learn the location of your home directory by issuing the `pwd` command. `pwd` is short for "present working directory".Â 

```
pwd
```

3. List all the contents in your home directory by using the `ls` command.

```
ls
```

Next try listing the contents in a more detailed view

```
ls -l
```

Next try listing all contents, including hidden files and directories

```
ls -al
```

Note that the `-al` flags (or options) do not have to be in any particular order. So you could also issue this command:

```
ls -la
```

4. Change directories to the root directory (or base directory) which is denoted by `/`
